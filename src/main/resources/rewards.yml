# Rewards to be issued to players for their individual maximum reputations
# Syntax: "initialRep;intervalRep;displayMessage;command..."
#   initialRep: The reward will first be given when a player's maximum reputation exceeds this amount
#   intervalRep: If greater than 0, will give this reward every time a player's max rep passes this interval after the initial mark
#     For instance, if initialRep is 200 and intervalRep is 50, players will receive this reward every 50 rep starting at 200 (i.e. 200, 250, 350, etc.)
#   displayMessage: true or false. If true, the player is shown a message when this reward is disbursed. 
#     Otherwise, they are not alerted at all
#   command: The command to run for this reward. Can be any commmand that the console can run.
#     Use "%p" as a placeholder for the name of this reward's recipient.
#     To have multiple commands, just create identical rewards with different commands
