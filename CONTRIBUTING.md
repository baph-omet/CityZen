When reporting issues with this plugin, it's important that you provide me with critical info so that I don't have to repeatedly ask for various things. Also, the more specific you can be, the easier and faster I can fix your issue.
Please report each issue or suggestion separately so that I can label and discuss them accordingly.

So when reporting issues, please include the following info:
* What version of the plugin and Bukkit/Spigot are you using? (Specific version numbers are best)
* What you were doing when the issue occurred (i.e. which command you were using, etc.):
* What were you expecting to happen and what actually happened:
* What message did the plugin give you, if any: 
* If you got a "internal error" message, please provide a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com) link of the stack trace (big, long Java error printed in console) that was given, if you can.
* If you encountered the error on the Test Server, please provide the time at which you encountered the error, including your timezone.
* If you're a server admin, you'll want to provide a pastebin link to each of your configs and the log file for the date the issue occurred, unless you're confident that one of the configs is not involved in this issue.
* Any other information:

Remember, please be as specific as you can and I'll do everything in my power to fix the issue. You will almost certainly be asked to provide additional info, so please check back on your issue regularly for updates.
